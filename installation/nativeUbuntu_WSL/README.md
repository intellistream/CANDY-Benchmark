# Notes

- Ubuntu 22.04 is required. Ubuntu 22.04 WSL also tested.
- Please just run `./start.sh`
- If your computer is reboot, run this again

## What does this do?

- If you have cuda, then install the cuda-based packages
- If you have GPU but without cuda, it installs cuda first, there is a reboot later, just run start.sh again
- If you don't even have GPU, it will go back to non-cuda version
